# 10. Quality Requirements

## 10.1 Quality goals (see also [§1.4](./introduction-and-goals.md))

| Priority | Quality goal | Motivation |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Safety & consent-correctness | The product's entire trust model depends on sharing being explicit, revocable, and never silently escalated |
| 2 | Privacy | Location is highly sensitive data; over-collection or leakage is the top reputational/legal risk |
| 3 | Reliability of "freshness" signals | False confidence in stale location is itself a safety hazard |
| 4 | Maintainability under a selected stack | The MVP is time-boxed to an internship schedule; changes must stay within the selected stack, or update the stack ADR |

## 10.2 Quality tree / scenarios

- **Safety:** sharing status and revocation must be understandable and
  reliable — a user must always be able to tell, at a glance, who currently
  has access to their location and stop it in one action.
- **Availability:** active sharing should tolerate intermittent connectivity
  and show stale state honestly rather than silently freezing on an old pin.
- **Performance:** maps and active-friend updates should load quickly on
  ordinary mobile networks.
- **Battery:** background tracking uses adaptive intervals and
  platform-approved background-location services (see
  [Security Control SC-07](../reference/security-control-register.md#sc-07-battery-and-stale-state-safety)).
- **Accessibility:** support screen readers, text alternatives, color
  contrast, captions, and reduced motion.
- **Scalability:** social and experimental workloads (challenges, prompts,
  discovery) must not degrade the core location-update path.
- **Auditability:** permission changes, moderation decisions, and security
  events are traceable (append-only audit log; see
  [Security Architecture](./security-architecture-and-data-protection.md)).
- **Portability:** users can export their account data and use external
  navigation apps rather than being locked in.

## 10.3 Acceptance criteria

See [MVP Requirements and Acceptance Criteria](../reference/mvp-requirements-and-acceptance-criteria.md)
and [Requirements Traceability Matrix](../reference/requirements-traceability-matrix.md)
for how each quality goal and REQ maps to concrete, testable criteria.
