# 9. Architecture Decisions

This section is an index into the [Architecture Decision Records](../adr) (ADRs). Do
**not** duplicate decision rationale here — link to the ADRs, which are the durable
source of truth for *why* a decision was made.

Add a row here whenever a new ADR is created. See [`adr/template.md`](../adr/template.md)
for the format used to write new ADRs, and [`adr/README.md`](../adr/README.md) for the
process.
