# Pinpoint — Quick Start (3-Day Setup)

This guide gets you running Pinpoint with friends in under 3 days. The
entire stack is pure Rust: API server (`pinpoint-server`) + desktop client
(`pinpoint-desktop`). The Go backend and web/mobile stacks are archived
under `archive/` (see ADR-0007/0008).

## Overview

Pinpoint is a privacy-first, consent-based location-sharing platform. Friends
can share their real-time location with explicit, revocable permission.

### Architecture

```

                                       │   • Friendships      │
                                       │   • Location sharing │
                                       │   • Server-side consent enforcement
                                       └──────────────────────┘

## Prerequisites

| Component | Version | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Rust | 1.70+ | Client + server |
| Web Browser | Optional | Browse `http://localhost:8000/` health check |
| Docker / Podman | Optional | Container deployment |

## Step 1: Install Rust

If you don't have Rust installed:

**Windows:**
1. Download `rustup-init.exe` from https://rustup.rs/
2. Run the installer
3. Restart your terminal
4. Verify: `cargo --version`

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Verify: `cargo --version` should show 1.70+.

## Step 2: Start the Backend

```bash
cargo run --bin pinpoint-server
```

The backend starts on **http://localhost:8000/** with:
- Demo accounts pre-seeded
- In-memory store (no database needed)
- Pure-Rust Axum server (`src/server/`, `src/bin/server.rs`)

### Demo Accounts

| Email | Password | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| alice@example.com | DemoPass123! | Resident |
| bob@example.com | DemoPass456! | Resident |
| admin@example.com | ChangeMe123! | Administrator (must change on first login) |

## Step 3: Open the Desktop Client

The Rust client is GUI (`eframe`). Run it in a second terminal:

```bash
cargo run -- --backend http://localhost:8000
```

The map opens immediately — no login required. You'll see demo friend locations (Alice, Bob, Carol) around Chicago.

The health check `curl http://localhost:8000/health` returns `{"status":"healthy","version":"0.1.0"}` when the server is up.

### What You Can Do Without Logging In

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| View map | See demo friend locations with precision indicators |
| Pan/zoom | Interactive map navigation |
| Search places | Search for cafés, pharmacies, parks via OpenStreetMap |
| Navigate | Click "Navigate" to open OpenStreetMap directions in your browser |
| Open on OSM | Open any location directly on OpenStreetMap.org |

### What Requires Sign-In

Click **Sign in** in the top-right to unlock:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Publish your location | Share your lat/lon with friends |
| Send friend requests | Invite friends by email |
| Accept/reject requests | Manage incoming friend requests |
| Create location shares | Grant friends access to your location (exact/approximate/city) |
| Pause/resume shares | Temporarily stop sharing without deleting |
| Admin panel | (administrator role only) |

## Step 4: Invite Friends

Friends don't need to install anything — they can use the web client on their phone:

1. Start the backend on your computer
2. Find your computer's IP address: `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig`/`ip addr` (Linux/macOS)
3. Tell friends to visit: `http://<YOUR-IP>:8000/` on their phone browser
4. They can sign in and you can send them friend requests

### Finding Your IP Address

**Windows:**
```powershell
ipconfig | findstr IPv4
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
ifconfig | grep inet
# or
ip addr show
```

Look for an address like `192.168.x.x` or `10.x.x.x`.

## Step 5: Android App (Optional)

If you want a native Android app instead of the web client:

### Prerequisites
- JDK 17
- Android SDK 35
- Android Studio (recommended)

### Build
```bash
cd mobile
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

The APK will be at `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

Install on your phone:
```bash
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

The debug APK points to `http://10.0.2.2:8000/api/v1/` (Android emulator). For a real device, change `API_BASE_URL` to your computer's IP.

## Step 6: Docker Deployment (Optional)

If you prefer Docker:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This starts:
- Go backend on port 8000
- Web client served via nginx on port 8080

Access: http://localhost:8080/

### Docker Compose Profiles

| Profile | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| (default) | Go backend + web client |
| python | Python/FastAPI backend alternative |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "go: command not found" | Install Go 1.23+ and add to PATH |
| Backend won't start | Check port 8000 is free: `netstat -ano \| findstr :8000` (Windows) or `lsof -i :8000` (Linux/Mac) |
| Web client won't load | Make sure backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/health` |
| Can't connect from phone | Ensure firewall allows port 8000; use your computer's IP, not localhost |
| Login fails | Use demo accounts; admin@example.com requires password change on first login |
| Map tiles don't load | Internet required for tile loading; attribution is shown per ODbL |
| Search doesn't work | Nominatim rate limit (1 req/s); wait and try again |

## Security Notes

- ✅ No trackers, no analytics, no advertising SDKs
- ✅ All consent decisions enforced server-side
- ✅ Session cookies are HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax
- ✅ CSRF double-submit on unsafe methods
- ✅ Plain HTTP only for loopback (production requires HTTPS)
- ✅ Friend locations are latest-only (no history stored)
- ✅ Directional consent: sharer controls precision and can revoke anytime
- ✅ Bookmarks stored on-device only, never synced

## Data & Privacy

| Data | Stored Where | Retention |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Account credentials | Server (hashed) | Until account deletion |
| Friend locations | Server (latest only) | Overwritten on publish |
| Bookmarks | Your device only | Until you delete them |
| Search/route queries | Session only | Not stored |
